Brehon (named after the private law system in ancient Ireland) is a third-party arbitration solution for smart contracts on the Ethereum network. This arbitration solution could enable any smart contract to be arbitrated if the parties involved raise a dispute about the intent and execution of the smart contract. 
Human arbitration allows for the creation of more complex smart contracts with the safety and enforceability of real world contracts. [Draft](/public/pdf/BrehonProposal-PositionPaper[Draft].pdf)
